Text Analysis Application

Text analytics, also known as text mining, is the methodology and process followed to derive quality and actionable information and insights from textual data.

This involves using NLP, information retrieval, and machine learning techniques to parse unstructured text data into more structured forms and deriving patterns and insights from this data that would be helpful for the end user.

Text analytics comprises a collection of machine learning, linguistic, and statistical techniques that are used to model and extract information from text primarily for analysis needs, including business intelligence, exploratory, descriptive, and predictive analysis.

NLP is defined as a specialized field of computer science and engineering and artificial intelligence with roots in computational linguistics. NLP techniques enable computers to process and understand natural human language and utilize it further to provide useful output.
